        <p>Hello, my name is Jobayer and I am passionate about streamlining problem-solving. My interest in web
          development began in 2012 when I started developing websites in WordPress CMS. I later worked as a Web
          Developer Executive at Innovi, where I registered and managed domain names, developed websites, and optimized
          them for search engines. At CML Consolidation and Logistics Services Ltd. as an IT Executive, I achieved the
          CargoWise Certified Professional certificate and implemented CargoWise One, including document templates and
          shipment logging. I also managed operational features and improved performance through application
          development. Currently, I work as a Senior Executive, ERP Administration at EUR Service BD Ltd., where I
          streamline business procedures, design workflows, and train users.</p>
        <p>My experience has given me in-depth knowledge of web development and logistics processes, as well as valuable
          project management and problem-solving skills. I am a quick learner and enjoy staying up-to-date with the
          latest industry trends and technologies. My goal is to utilize my skills and knowledge to contribute to the
          success of any team or organization I am a part of.</p>
        <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
